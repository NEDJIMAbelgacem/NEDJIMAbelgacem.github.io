      <description>HI,
With the Google summer of code final results out today (8 September 2020). I thought I should make a blog post my experience in Google Summer of Code project, how I got into the program, what I did and how it went. It was an amazing experience and I highly recommend any student to participate in the program.
What is GSoC ? From the GSoC website:
 Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development.</description>
